# Snake Bytes Dinner Planner - Console Edition 💻

Snake Bytes Dinner Planner is a console-based Python app that helps users generate a weekly meal plan based on their input. 🐍

Users are prompted to enter dinner meal ideas one at a time, with input validation to prevent blanks or numbers-only entries. 

Once submitted, the app shuffles the ideas and generates a 7-day meal plan, including a special "Treat Night" for a break from home cooking! 😄
